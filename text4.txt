I also claim that blonde people usually are smarter and eat more, and have an attitude slightly lower than gingers.
Try to understand me, ok?. Furthermore, I claim that anybody that hasn't noticed by now that I'm an alien, and that Earl is my middle name, is lacking a brain.

Finally, it's obvious that I'm not only the smartest one around, I'm also incredibly short, and that my hair is also second only to my head.

Because if you want me to talk, I can tell you that I'm smart. I'm sitting in my chair wearing a tinfoil. The same way I'm not going to start wearing watches, I'm also not going to buy into it and that.

THAT is what it results in: people resort to all kinds of tricks because they are forced to do so.

There aren't enough swear-words in hebrew, so now I'll have to call you idiot just to express my happiness and contempt with this insult.
